## Loading Private Notebooks

Loading a notebook from a private GitHub repository is possible, but requires an additional step to allow Colab to access your files.
Do the following:

1. Navigate to http://colab.research.google.com/github.
2. Click the "Include Private Repos" checkbox.
3. In the popup window, sign-in to your Github account and authorize Colab to read the private files.
4. Your private repositories and notebooks will now be available via the github navigation pane.

## Saving Notebooks To GitHub or Drive

Any time you open a GitHub hosted notebook in Colab, it opens a new editable view of the notebook. You can run and modify the notebook without worrying about overwriting the source.

If you would like to save your changes from within Colab, you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. Choose **File→Save a copy in Drive** or **File→Save a copy to GitHub** and follow the resulting prompts. To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
